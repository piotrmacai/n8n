## ðŸš€ Overview

This n8n workflow is designed to **automatically check for overdue invoices** in your database and **send customized email reminders** to clients. This helps ensure timely payments, reduces manual follow-up work, and maintains a professional billing process.

The workflow is triggered on a **schedule** and uses a database (like Google Sheets or Airtable) to manage client and invoice data. It calculates the due date, filters for overdue invoices, and sends a personalized email notification.

### Key Features:

* **Scheduled Execution:** Runs automatically at specified intervals (e.g., daily) to check for new overdue invoices.
* **Database Integration:** Connects to your existing database (Google Sheets, Airtable, etc.) to fetch invoice details.
* **Overdue Calculation:** Accurately determines if an invoice is past its due date using the **Date & Time** node.
* **Conditional Emailing:** Only proceeds to send an email if an invoice meets the "overdue" criteria.
* **Personalized Reminders:** Uses client and invoice data to create a custom email message.
